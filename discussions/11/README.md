## Web Authentication

11.1 The HTTP protocol is "stateless", which forces site/app developers to implement their own state-tracking mechanism. What does this have to do with security? How stateful communication is implemented over HTTP?

11.2 Why must an authenticator-token cookie be tamper-proof and unforgeable?

Let us consider the following vulnerabilities?

- Content Spoofing
- CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
- XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
- SQLi (SQL injection)

For each of the, describe:

11.3 What is the attacker's goal behind exploiting these vulnerabilities?

11.4 How would the attacker detect the presence of such a vulnerability in a given web application?

11.5 How would the attack being setup?

11.6 What gain can the attacker get if the attack succeeds?
