# CSCD27 Discussion 4

## Hash's, MAC's and Digital Signatures

4.1 List the 3 properties that a hash function must exhibit to be considered secure (if you don't remember the name, give a brief description of the property):

4.2 Which hash property/ies does the birthday attack target?

4.3 When using a symmetric encryption algorithm with
an n-bit key, the size of the brute-force search space to find the key is: _________________. When using a secure-hash function with n-bit input and m-bit output, the size of the brute-force search-space for a collision is: _________________.

4.4 MAC's

- What security property does a MAC provide that a secure-hash does not?
- What property is provided by both MAC and secure-hash?
- What property does a MAC not provide that a digital-signature provides?

## Cryptography protocols

4.5 Challenge-response protocol

- adds what kind of data to the protocol?
- achieves what?
- protects against what kind of attack?

4.6 What is a double challenge-response protocol? What does it achieve?

4.7 Describe the man-in-the-middle attack on the Needham-Shroeder protocol?

## Trust models

4.8 Describe how a man-in-the-middle attack on GPG could succeed?

4.9 Describe how a man-in-the-middle attack on HTTPs could succeed?
